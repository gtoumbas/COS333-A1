George: 

After Shanzay and I decided on how we wanted to structure our code, 
I wrote a substantial portion of the intial version of reg_db.py. I wrote
working versions of the get_search_query, get_details_query, and display_table 
methods. I also wrote a python script which reads arguments from a txt file
and compares the outputs of our program on those arguments with the outputs
of the reference .pyc files. Using this program, I tested regdetails.py on every
entry classid in the database and tested reg.py against all example args on the
assignment page + some additional args.  


Shanzay: 

Shanzay was responsible for writing the regdetails.py and reg.py files. She 
also wrote the replace_wildcards and format_args methods in reg_db.py. She 
implemented the exception handling in reg_db.py and she revised the code 
in reg_db.py to protect against SQL injections. She also wrote a majority of 
the doctstrings and handled pylint checking.

Outside Help:
Just python online documentation.

Time Spent: ~15 hours

Assesment of Assignment:

I enjoyed it! I had never interacted with a SQL db from python. I also feel 
that I learned a lot from writing automated testing. It was a lot more work 
than I initially anticipated. Also, it is worth noting that Shanzay was quite 
sick for over a week with covid during this assigment.
